Ubuntu post-installation script
===============================

With this Python script you will avoid wasting time to install and 
configure your Ubuntu 12.04 operating system. Just download this script, 
run it with your favorite configuration file and ... envoy !

The script can:

* Install Ubuntu repositories (deb repos, PPA, ...)
* Install packages
* Configure dots files (.bashrc, .vimrc, ...)
* Configure the user interface (support Unity and Gnome Shell)
* Run every command line

## How to use this script ?

Just download and run it with the following command lines:

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/nicolargo/ubuntupostinstall/master/ubuntu-12.04-postinstall.py
    $ chmod a+x ubuntu-12.04-postinstall.py
    $ sudo ./ubuntu-12.04-postinstall.py

By default, the script will download and use this configuration file.
https://github.com/nicolargo/ubuntupostinstall/blob/master/ubuntu-12.04-unity-postinstall.cfg

## Use anothers configurations files

Using the -c option, you can select an alternative configuration file.

For example, you can configure Ubuntu for Gnome Shell using:

    $ sudo ./ubuntu-12.04-postinstall.py -c https://raw.github.com/nicolargo/ubuntupostinstall/master/ubuntu-12.04-gnomeshell-postinstall.cfg

If you want to use a local confgiuration file (adapted to yours needs):

    $ sudo ./ubuntu-12.04-postinstall.py -c mycfg.cfg

## Create your own configuration file

The configuration files is organized into sections, and each section 
can contain name-value pairs for configuration data.

### preactions section

This is the first section of the configuration file.

A line starting with the action_ string (following by the action name) defines a 
action (command line) to be executed.

The action name will be displayed during the script execution.

The lines will be executed before all the others steps.

Example:

    [preactions]
    action_dummy = dpkg -l > /tmp/pkg-before.txt

The dummy action will create a /tmp/pkg-before.txt with a listing of 
all the packages installed on your system.

### repos section

In this section, user can install the repositories (deb repository or PPA).

* ppa_xxx = ppa:ppauser/ppaname > Add the ppa:ppauser/ppaname to the system
* pkg_xxx = pkglist             > Add the package list (space separed) to the system
* url_xxx = http://reposurl     > Add the repository URL to the system 
* key_xxx = key                 > Add the repository key to the system 

xxx define the name of the action and will be displayed during the script execution.

Example:

    [repos]
    ppa_glances = ppa:arnaud-hartmann/glances-stable
    pkg_glances = glances
    
Install the Glances PPA on the system and install the glances software.

### packages section

From this section, you can install all your softwares, gathered by 
function, needs...

Example:

    [packages]
    network = iftop ifstat
    dev = vim git 

Install iftop, ifstat, vim and git. Display "Install network packages" and "Install 
dev packages" during the script execution.

### dotfiles section

This section is dedicated to the dot files (.bash, .vimrc...) installed in your 
home folder. 

The script can install the following dot files from URL:

* bashrc: BASH main configuration file
* bashrc_prompt: BASH prompt configuration
* bashrc_aliases: BASH aliases
* vimrc: VIM main configuration file
* htoprc: HTOP main configuration file

Example:

    [dotfiles]
    bashrc = https://raw.github.com/nicolargo/dotfiles/master/bashrc

Create the ~/.bashrc from the https://raw.github.com/nicolargo/dotfiles/master/bashrc

### unity and gnome3 sections

Configure Unity or Gnome Shell:

* theme: Configure the GTK theme (name)
* icons: Configure the icons theme (name)
* cursors: Configure the cursors theme (name)
* conky: Conky main configuration file (URL)

For the themes, packages have to be installed in the repos or packages sections.

    [gnome3]
    theme = Boomerang
    icons = Faenza
    cursors = DMZ-White
    conky = https://raw.github.com/nicolargo/ubuntupostinstall/master/conkyrc

Configure Gnome Shell with the Boomerang GTK theme, Faenza icons and DMZ-White 
cursors. Configure Conky with the https://raw.github.com/nicolargo/ubuntupostinstall/master/conkyrc 
configuration file.

You can NOT use both unity and gnome3 section in the same .cfg file.

### postactions section

This is the last section of the configuration file.

A line starting with the action_ string (following by the action name) defines a 
action (command line) to be executed.

The action name will be displayed during the script execution.

The lines will be executed after all the others steps.

Example:

    [postactions]
    action_dummy = dpkg -l > /tmp/pkg-after.txt

The dummy action will create a /tmp/pkg-before.txt with a listing of 
all the packages installed on your system after the script execution.
